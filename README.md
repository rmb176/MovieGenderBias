# MovieGenderBias
Final project for CS1699: AI for Good: Ethics and Implications

Jared Belsky and Ryan Bennett 


## Description and Goals
For this project, we plan to analyze gender bias in movie plot summaries over time. This is important because many AI models are trained on large text datasets such as a movie corpus. Identifying and exploring these potential biases is an important ethical consideration. We plan to explore the corpus and run basic NLP analyses on the movie summaries to determine gender bias, ranking movies for bias over time. 

## Datsets used
For this project we utilized the CMU movie corpus: [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/)

The corpus consisted of three main files we used
1. The character metadata `character.metadata.tsv`
2. The movie metadata `movie.metadata.tsv`
3. The movie summaries `plot_summaries.txt`
